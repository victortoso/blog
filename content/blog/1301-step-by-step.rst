Time goes by when you finally finish your 18 years studying things that people
said you need to learn. Finally you start doing more and more things that you
want to do. Learning what you think is interesting and working with what you
love.

I'm entering in a new phase of my life.

I've been working in a few projects that made most of my days goes by in a blink
of an eye. Which is something that would make most of us really happy.

But it was recently that I felt a different kind of happiness with my work.

I was studying how `Grilo`_ works to use it in small project of mine.

Out of curiosity, I began to have more interest in how exactly Grilo works and
the features that were expected to its future. It was about time to `GSoC`_ period
start and I felt quite comfortable at seeking guidance with Grilo developers to
share my will to help.

A little more than a month since my first contact with the community and I'm
still trying to make some code reach upstream `a plugin`_ but... what amazing
experience this has been!

I didn't know Magnatune until Juan introducing it to me. It's really nice
(`check it out`_).

Even if some audio players have already a good Magnatune plugin
(like `Rhythmbox`_), the plugin I'm working on could be useful for others
applications that may be integrated with Grilo.

The feeling of usefulness that I rarely felt with others projects I have worked,
I found after this time I've spent with Grilo.

I'm really excited with all this. I'm learning a lot and I truly believe that I
can help a lot more.

Step by step, giving back to the community what I've been using for so many
years!
