It has been four months since the GSoC 2013 code submission. At that time the
Lua-Factory Plugin was usable but yet with `some issues`_ to be dealt.

It was in the last two weeks that most of those issues were solved together with
a few recommendations from `Juan`_ and `Bastien`_ and tonight it was merged upstream
in Grilo-Plugins repository.

Hooray!

The documentation for implementing a Lua sources will come soon.

If you want to try it, you can always find some guidance in #grilo channel.
