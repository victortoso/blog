**Another great summer is coming.**

I was accepted, `once again`_, at Google Summer of Code program! I am really
excited with the project. I'll have fun with `Grilo`_ again by implementing a few
new plugins and integrating them to Videos and Music.

Check the `wiki of the project`_ for more info.

Many thanks to Google for this amazing program and to `Bastien`_, which will be
mentoring me during this period.

**Partner in this Summer of Coding!**

Once again we have two brazilians in the GNOME-SoC, me and my great friend
Watson Sato (`yuuma`_)! He'll be working in a security module to Evolution. Good
luck!

So, Let's have fun!
