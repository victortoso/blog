**gom**

Most of the work I've being doing since last report is improving the TVDB source
in Grilo Plugins in order to have a cache for all data that you have once
downloaded from thetvdb.com.

I'm doing that with gom.

At first I thought it was a bit complicated as creating sql queries directly is
easier. But under the hood gom does a lot of useful things that you don't even
need to bother thinking. It is good to see that `it was moved`_ to
git.gnome.org.

Also, It was really good to see `Magnatune`_ working when I was reading the
`last post`_ from Sai. It was my first patch to GNOME :). I'm thinking about
updating the Magnatune source with gom in the near future and probably with more
features. Let's see!

Note: One could check the thetvdb source patches `here`_.

**Next**

The integration with GNOME Videos! I'm excited to see this working :)

Oh yeah! I loved last year conference and I wouldn't miss this year. Thanks very
much to the GNOME Foundation for helping out with the sponsorship.
