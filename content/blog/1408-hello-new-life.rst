Since the end of the Google Summer of Code 2014 so many things have happened
that It is really hard to make a simple blog post about it... but I must try :)

**New job**

Well, along with the GSoC I've applied to a job at `Red Hat`_ and the process
ended in August. Since October 15th I am part of the `Spice`_ team and I will be
working at the Brno office in Czech Republic.

I am really excited with the work and with the team. I am learning a lot
already.

**New City**

I have visited Brno at `GUADEC 2013`_, lovely city. I feel safe here unlike
Campinas in Brazil.

I have great expectations about living here and so do my wife after reading
Christian's blog post about `leaving Brno`_.

**Married**

Yay ;) Yes, biggest decision of my life.

We have been together for almost three years now and we were living together for
almost one year which made this decision straightforward for me. `Catielle`_ is a
wonderful person and I am really happy with our marriage. I feel that we are
going to be very happy here in Brno.

**Pending**

Well, I was quite a busy in the last two months but I still have a lot of things
to do!

A few blog posts about GUADEC, GSoC and Grilo
I want to move this Blog to Pelican :-)
Finishing off a few things related to the last GSoC project, making it upstream!
Writing a documentation for the lua-factory plugin :-)

That's all for now! I will be back hacking and blogging now that things are
getting calmer.
