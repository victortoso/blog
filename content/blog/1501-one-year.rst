It's been almost one year since my last blog post. One year since I got married
and left Brazil to live in Czech Republic. In my `last post`_ I talked about all
the changes I was passing through but no change is bigger than having a baby.
`Tereza`_ has almost 4 months now :)

One year at `Red Hat`_ and `Spice`_.

Even with the great amount of things to do in personal and professional life, I
want to keep making GNOME better as much as I can in my free time and thus I
want to get back to blogging again.

I've finally managed to migrate from Blogger to `Pelican`_ so I hope that more
personal posts like this one will not be part of Planet GNOME in the future :)

I also plan to blog more about personal stuff such as being a father or living
abroad. I hope that it can ease the distance from family and friends in Brazil.

This one year was just crazy. Time flies and nothing like raising a child to
realize that.

Cheers!
