[GUADEC 2013](https://2013.guadec.org) was hosted in Brno, Czech Republic and it
was my first time doing a talk for a big audience, quite an experience! I can
see how nervous I got in the two minutes I had for the interns lightning talk.

Not super instructive video to watch but quite funny to me :)

Also, It is very interesting that a little bit more then a year later, I would
be moving to Brno to start a new phase of my life.
